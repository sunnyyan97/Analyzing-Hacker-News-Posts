# Analyzing-Hacker-News-Posts

For this project I used Python to analyze posts from Hacker News, a social news website focusing on computer science and entrepreneurship started by the startup incubator Y Combinator. Purpose of this project is to analyze which types of posts get the highest amount of engagement, measure by amount of comments. 

I first determined which type of posts get the highest number of comments and then I explored the optimal times of day to post to increase the number of comments. A sample of this is seen below. The full code is attached to a Jupyter Notebook in the repository.
